                        The pilaster is a rectangular or column-like architectural element that projects from a 
                        wall and is often used for decorative purposes. It usually resembles a flattened column 
                        and typically features a base, shaft, and capital. Pilasters are usually attached to a 
                        wall and do not provide any structural support, and are most used for decoration.</p>

                        the two curves of the arch meet at an apex. It was commonly used in Gothic and Islamic

                        The pediment is a triangular or gable-shaped architectural element that crowns a structure, 
                        such as a building facade or a portico. It is typically located above the entablature and 
                        supported by columns or pilasters. Pediments often feature decorative sculptures or reliefs 
                        and serve as a prominent focal point in classical architecture.</p>

                        The portico is a classical archetypal structure consisting of a roof 
                        supported by columns or pillar, typically forming a covered entrance to a building. 
                        They are often found at the main entrance of a building and serve both functional and 
                        aesthetic purposes. They can provide shade and cover from rain or sun while also adding
                        a grand entrance to a building. They were extremely popular in Greek and Roman Architecture, 
                        and formed the entrance to many of their iconic buildings and monuments.</p>

                        The Roman Arch is a classic type of architectural structure that
                        was widely used by the Ancient Romans in their buildings, monuments, and aqueducts. 
                        It is made up of a curved or pointed structure that spans an opening, which is 
                        formed by two vertical supports or columns. The arch bears weight by distributing it 
                        cross its curved shape, effectively creating a new horizontal plane above the opening. 
                        However, this conic structure is used more decoratively in modern design.</p>

                        not have open passageways or windows behind them. It involves the use of arches and
                        columns to create a repetitive pattern on a wall surface, typically in a row or series.
                        Blind arcading can be seen in various architectural styles, such as Romanesque and Gothic,
                        and is often used to add visual interest and texture to facades.</p>
