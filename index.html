                    <p class="image-text">The ionic scroll is a decorative element used heavily in Greek and 
                        Roman architecture. The ionic scroll is part oft the capital of the column, which sits
                        atop the shaft. The capital itself is characterized by its pair of volutes, which 
                        resemble rams' horns. These scrolls add a beautiful, ornamental touch to any ionic column 
                        and were widely used in Ancient Greece and Rome as well as in later classical 
                        and Renaissance architecture.</p>

                    <p class="image-text">The pointed arch is a type of arch with a pointed crown, where 
                        the two curves of the arch meet at an apex. It was commonly used in Gothic and Islamic 
                        rchitecture, replacing the rounded arch that was prevalent in Romanesque architecture. 
                        It allowed for the distribution of weight and pressure more efficiently, which enabled 
                        the construction of larger and more elaborate buildings like cathedrals. Today many 
                        churches of the catholic denomination continue the use of pointed arches.</p>

                    <h3 class="image-title">Roman Arch</h3>
                    <p class="image-text">The Roman Arch is a classic type of architectural structure that
                        was widely used by the Ancient Romans in their buildings, monuments, and aqueducts. 
                        It is made up of a curved or pointed structure that spans an opening, which is 
                        formed by two vertical supports or columns. The arch bears weight by distributing it 
                        cross its curved shape, effectively creating a new horizontal plane above the opening. 
                        However, this conic structure is used more decoratively in modern design.</p>

                    <p class="image-text">The portico is a classical archetypal structure consisting of a roof 
                        supported by columns or pillar, typically forming a covered entrance to a building. 
                        They are often found at the main entrance of a building and serve both functional and 
                        aesthetic purposes. They can provide shade and cover from rain or sun while also adding
                        a grand entrance to a building. They were extremely popular in Greek and Roman Architecture, 
                        and formed the entrance to many of their iconic buildings and monuments.</p>

                        decoration, which includes acanthus leaves and flower patterns. Corinthian capitals 
                        are typically used atop columns or pilasters, and are often found in grand public buildings, 
                        like temples, churches, and government buildings. They are considered to be one of the
                        most elaborate and decorative types of capital in Greek and Roman architecture. In the
                        modern age, they can be found in a myraid of buildings, from grand chruches to modest homes.</p>
